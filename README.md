Firebase5 is a practicing project.

We have three members to build up NoSQL database of Firebase together.

There are three simple features:
  1. Login
  2. Adding friends
  3. Searching artiles with author, title or both.
  
But as a practitcing project of Firebase, all the results would only show in console log.
